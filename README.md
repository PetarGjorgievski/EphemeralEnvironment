# EphemeralEnvironment

## Description:
### A passion project intended to create ephemeral environments on AWS using GitHub, CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, CloudFormation, S3 and SNS

## What are Ephemeral Environments?
### Ephemeral environments are also sometimes called “Dynamic environments”, “Temporary environments”, “on-demand environments” or “short-lived environments”. The idea is that instead of environments “hanging around” waiting for someone to use them, the CI/CD pipeline stages are responsible for instantiating and destroying the environments they will run against.
